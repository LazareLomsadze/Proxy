 The Advantages of Minimal Proxy Contracts : 
 
⭐ Cost-Efficiency: Deploying a smart contract incurs gas costs. By using minimal proxy contracts, you only pay the deployment cost once for the master contract and significantly lower costs for subsequent deployments.

⭐ Reduced Blockchain Bloat: Deploying multiple instances of the same contract can lead to blockchain bloat. Minimal proxy contracts help reduce this bloat by reusing the master contract’s code.

⭐ Upgradability: Since minimal proxy contracts act as intermediaries, you can upgrade the logic of the master contract while preserving the state stored in the proxy contracts. This allows for more flexible and modular contract upgrades.

⭐ Ethereum Name Service (ENS) Support: Minimal proxy contracts can be combined with ENS to create user-friendly and cost-effective decentralized applications.
